# Data structures 
# data  structures are sued to store mulit[le values in a single varibale
# lists , tuples , sets , dictionaries are the most commonly used data structures in python

# List
a = [1,2,4.5,"akshat"] 
print(a)

# List are mutuable
b = [3,4,5,6]
b[2]= 7  #list indexing
print(b)

# List's slicing and indexing are same as string's
c = [6,7,9,3,5]
print(c[:2]) #list slicing

# we can store duplicate values in a list
d = [ 1,5,6,1,5,6,1,5,6,1,5,6,1,5,6]
print(d)
