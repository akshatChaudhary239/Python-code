# For loops
# we use for loop when we have a number of how many time we have to iterate our loops


# printing numbers from 10 to 40
for number in range(10,41,1):   # "i" is used for iteration over elements
    print(akku)

# printing numbers from -10 to 20
for num in range(-10,21,1):
    print(num)

# printing number from 34 to 5
for num1 in range(34,5,-1):
    print(num1)

# printing my name 10 time with count
for name in range(1,11,1):
    print("Akku",name)

# printing the table of 5
for table in range(5,51,5):
    print(table)
